- LANS PCs and work station had been developed in 1980's, the internet scale was increase, there was some management issue happend, for optimization purposeï¼Œthe host had been named, not numeric address any more, that had help people remember simpler.

- Paul Mockapetris had invented DNS--Domain name systerm, the internet address become as same as nowarday.

- In the 1970s, people began to experiment with computer networks based on packet switching technology, and began to study the technology of communication between computers of different manufacturers. In the 1980s, a network capable of interconnecting multiple computers emerged. Network communication technology has entered the highway of development.

- The development and popularization of computer technology makes people no longer unfamiliar with the Internet. As the difficulty of operating a computer continues to decline, it has narrowed the distance between people and the Internet.

- In the 1990s, as the price of computers decreased, their performance increased, and various applications emerged one after another, the popularity of computers became higher and higher.

  At the same time, e-mail, World Wide Web and other information dissemination methods have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and have ushered in unprecedented development, making the Internet widely popular in every family from the large to the entire company.

  In the face of this trend, each manufacturer must not only ensure the interconnectivity of their products, but also focus on making their network technologies continuously compatible with Internet technologies (TCP/IP).

##### Q2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- packets
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
- routers and routing
- domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

> Packet

- Fixed size unit of data
  When we send data from our computer to receiver on internet, the data such as a picture, image, our folder will be independently transmitted over to receiver, we call that packet.
- The packet idea is from Paul Baran & Donald Davies, Donald is actually the one who was ideas been noticed by some of the people who started to build the first ARPANET. That two guys share their credit and ideas of packet switched networks which really is one of the core concepts.

> IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

- IP (Internet protocol)
  It is a numeric address that identifier for a computer or device on a network. Every device has to have an IP address for communication purposes.
- IP address includes:
  - A network address
  - A host address
- IP type:
  - IPv4
    IPv4 is 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods.
    It is ther current version of IP addresses.
    (e.x 66.94.234.13; the last number 13 can be the number range from 0-255)
    4,294,967,296 possible unique addresses.
  - IPv6
    - IPv6 is the nex gneration of IP addresses
    - 128-bit hexadecimal address.
    - Hexadecimal uses both numbers and alphabets.
    - Capabl of roducing over 340 undecllo address.

> routers and routing
> Resources( https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/router?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=lyIUgr9JOLs&offer=video-lyIUgr9JOLs )

- What is routers?
  Router is passes information between computer networks and allows our devices to connect to the internet and share data, whether it's a computer, smartphone or tablet. A router inspects a data packet's destination IP address, then figures out the best way for it to get to its destination.

- What is routing?
  The processing each data packet sending from data center to our divice, the data flow is forms backbone of the internet.
  That whole efficient data flow transmission between source to destination we call it routing.
  This whole process of the efficient flow of data from the source to its destination is known as routing.
  There are two categories of routing:

  - Static
    Static routes are set in a router manually. Thus, if there is any change in the network, there will not be any change in the route, unless someone manually corrects it.

  - Dynamic
    In dynamic routing, routes are set by the software that according to the current state of the network. Network changes such as link failures, traffic changes and cost changes will be updated at every discrete time step. And based on this information, new routes will be decided at each time step.
    Dynamic routing is preferred over than static routing, because the routers will update themselves.

> domains and DNS

##### Q3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- TCP
- HTTP and HTTPS
- web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

---

##### Q4.Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.50 - 100 words on each data structure

---

##### Q5.Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.100 - 200 words on each way code is executed

---

##### Q6. Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each. 200 - 400 words on each language
